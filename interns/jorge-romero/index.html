<p>I have many interests that I'm invested in. The largest interest of mine right now is music, as to me it
 serves as a way for me to focus on work and also complement how I feel in a certain moment. 
I mostly listen to rap, with LUCKI, Autumn!, Summrs and Yeat being my favorite artists right now
Other casual interests of mine are basketball, football, gaming, and drawing.
</p>

<h6>Internship & Future:</h6>

<p>The internship at Red Hat has been a great experience that has gave me lots of insight into how profesional companies look like and operate.
 While there could be some adjustments made for future programs, this pilot program was a good place to start. As for my future and career,
 I have nothing set in stone yet, but I hope I find something that I would enjoy doing for the rest of my life.
